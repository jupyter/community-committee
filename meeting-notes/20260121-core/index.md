### Action items

- [ ] Rosio: Re-open ticket for December community call recording, CC Jason
- [ ] All: Finalize our charter. We need that before we can say we're a "committee". EC needs to be involved, vote, etc.


### Agenda & notes

- Trying out the new note-taking workflow for the first time! :tada:
- Community meeting?
    - Help request: How can Rosio get the recording? Last community meeting was in December, it was supposed to have been recorded. Rosio asked for a link to the recording from LF through a helpdesk ticket, but got some pushback. Is this the right avenue? Jeremy doesn't have difficulty getting recording links for the contributor call.
        - Jason: Yes, requesting the recording through an LF ticket was the procedure they gave us to do
    - Future community calls: Set the hackmd to be editable by everyone.
        - Add to the host guide!
    - Rosio: There's a timeline of preparation steps that are taken before a community call. Could start outlining the dates for that and document it.
